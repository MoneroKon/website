### What is Monerokon?

Monero Konferenco (“MoneroKon”) is an annual meeting of privacy advocates, cypherpunks, researchers, and developers and is designed to disseminate scientific and technical results in privacy-enhancing technologies and distributed systems. Marking its fourth year, the upcoming 3-day event will be held once again at the renowned Paralelní Polis in the Czech Republic from 7th-9th of June 2024. Come participate in discussions and help us move privacy forward one conversation at a time.

### What is a Volunteer?

Volunteers are individuals who generously contribute their free time to our event. While attendees typically recognize volunteers as those managing ticket scanners, checking wristbands, or serving coffee during breaks, there are numerous tasks happening "behind the scenes" that often go unnoticed (until some chair goes amiss). Whether it's a newcomer assisting at Monerokon for the first time or seasoned organizers meticulously planning months in advance, everyone involved, from start to finish, qualifies as a volunteer.

### Benefits

Volunteering also offers some advantages. While we believe that contributing is gratifying in itself, here are some perks exclusively available to volunteers:

- Recognition within the community
- A free Monerokon ticket + T-shirt
- Complimentary coffee, water and 1 free meal per day/shift
- A limited Monerokon volunteer baseball cap
(- Access to the Volunteer Hub and the volunteer lounge with its relaxing atmosphere)

### Expectations and Guidelines

When volunteering at Monerokon, we have a few simple yet essential expectations for all participants. We kindly ask that you commit to the following guidelines:

- Arrive on time for your shift or provide early notice if unable to attend.
- Ensure you are well-rested, sober, and have eaten before your shift.
- Approach each task with an open-minded and friendly attitude.
- Embrace and uphold our moral values, which include:

  a. Treating others with excellence and respect.

  b. Welcoming all beings without discrimination.

- Work a total of 8h

### When to arrive?

If you are primarily attending the event itself, it is generally recommended to arrive on day 0, which precedes the official start of the event. On this day, we will complete the setup and the essential infrastructure. The venue is less crowded on day 0, allowing attendees to explore the area and familiarize themselves with the surroundings before the event kicks into full swing.

So, if you are interested in gaining a more in-depth understanding of event operations and are willing to engage in physical tasks such as lifting heavy objects and arranging furniture, arriving early to lend a hand with setup is encouraged.

### Becoming a Hero

For those aspiring to go above and beyond, consider assisting with teardown rather than setup. While many individuals eagerly volunteer for setup tasks, there is often a shortage of helping hands during teardown. By contributing to dismantling activities post-event, you can expedite the process of wrapping up and ensure that everyone can catch up on missed talks sooner.

### Communication Protocol

In our operational setup, effective communication is key to ensuring a smooth and coordinated event. To facilitate seamless interaction among our team members, radios will be utilized as the primary mode of communication. All seasoned organizers (aka staff) will be equipped with radios, which will also be available for volunteers at the registration desk and at the IoC (Institute of Cryptoanarchy). This system enables quick and efficient information exchange, allowing us to address any issues promptly and maintain a well-organized environment throughout the event.
