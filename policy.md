### Safety and Security

All life forms, regardless of their age, gender or upbringing are welcomed at MoneroKon.

We are dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable experience for everybody attending our events, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, physical appearance or disability. We do not tolerate harassment of participants of the Konferenco in any form. We don't tolerate life forms who refuse to share this openness towards others.

The MoneroKon will always be a place where people can enjoy technology and culture, no matter what their background is. To keep it that way: If someone is misbehaving and you want support, let a MoneroKon volunteer know, they will be glad to help. Have the courage to ask us!
