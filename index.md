### A conference in privacy-enhancing technologies and distributed systems
Monero Konferenco ("MoneroKon") is an annual meeting of privacy advocates, cypherpunks, researchers, and developers and is designed to disseminate scientific and technical results in privacy-enhancing technologies and distributed systems. Marking its fourth year, the upcoming 3-day event will be held once again at the renowned Paraleln√≠ Polis in the Czech Republic from 7th-9th of June 2024. Come participate in discussions and help us move privacy forward one conversation at a time.
