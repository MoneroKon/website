# A technical conference in privacy and financial technology
Monero Konferenco is an annual meeting of privacy advocates, cypherpunks, scientists, and philosophers and is designed to disseminate scientific and technical results in privacy and financial technologies like censorship-resistant digital cash. The event is funded by generous donations from the Monero community and support from sponsors.

### Privacy is a fundamental right
We consider privacy to be a fundamental human right, and we acknowledge that the use of privacy technology is, for some, a matter of personal safety.

### We hope you can contribute
Come participate in discussions, make a proposal, and help us move privacy forward one conversation at a time. A cashless society lacking basic financial privacy can not remain an open society for long.
