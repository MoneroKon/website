### A conference & hackathon in privacy-enhancing technologies and distributed systems
Monero Konferenco ("MoneroKon") is an annual meeting of privacy advocates, cypherpunks, researchers, and developers and is designed to disseminate scientific and technical results in privacy-enhancing technologies and distributed systems.

### Volunteers

We need lots of help to get this community-driven event off the ground, from graphic designers, help with attendee registration, to stagehands. If you would like to volunteer in some capacity, contact us.
